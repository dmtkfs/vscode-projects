# CodeIgniter 3.1.13 Security Assessment Project

This repository provides an overview of a comprehensive security vulnerability assessment conducted on **CodeIgniter 3.1.13** (the final legacy version), using its default configuration. The project's primary aim was to methodically identify and evaluate inherent security vulnerabilities within the framework's core functionalities.

### ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
This project and repository are intended solely for educational purposes, demonstrating practical cybersecurity techniques and illustrating the importance of secure application development practices. No malicious use or intent is permitted or supported.

## **Project Overview**

In this cybersecurity assessment, we conducted a detailed analysis to identify, evaluate, and document potential vulnerabilities present within the CodeIgniter 3.1.13 core framework. The project encompassed static code analysis, manual code review, dynamic runtime testing, and enumeration techniques.

### **Types of Vulnerabilities Investigated**

- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SQL Injection (Raw queries and Query Builder misuse)
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) via file uploads
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Session Hijacking and Privilege Escalation
- Information Disclosure (error handling misconfigurations)
- HTTP Header Injection and Session Security
- Log Poisoning
- Session Fixation and Session Management Issues
- Directory Enumeration and default exposure risks

### **Tools and Methodology**
A combination of popular security analysis tools and methodologies was applied, including (but not limited to):

- **Static Analysis**: PHPStan, SonarQube  
- **Dynamic Testing & Exploitation**: Burp Suite, ZAP, sqlmap, curl  
- **Enumeration Tools**: Gobuster (directory enumeration)

A detailed testing methodology was followed, progressively escalating tests from basic enumeration to confirmed exploit attempts, providing clear evidence of vulnerabilities.

### **Key Findings (Summary)**

- **Critical** vulnerabilities were identified in default configurations (e.g., disabled CSRF, unrestricted file uploads allowing arbitrary code execution).
- **High-risk practices** were confirmed (such as SQL injection through raw SQL queries and improper Query Builder usage, absence of output sanitization leading to stored XSS, and insufficient session handling leading to session hijacking).
- **Medium-level risks** included directory exposure (`/vendor/`) and information disclosure via verbose error messages (`db_debug = TRUE`).

### **Recommendations & Best Practices**
This assessment underscores the importance of following secure coding practices and properly configuring built-in security features. Some general security recommendations include:

- Enabling CSRF protection.
- Always using parameterized queries.
- Restricting and validating file uploads.
- Sanitizing user input before rendering (XSS protection).
- Improving session management and secure cookie handling.
- Proper server-side directory protection and secure configuration practices.

### **PIPEDA Compliance Implications**
Applications managing personally identifiable information (PII) must proactively secure user data, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards like Canada's PIPEDA. The vulnerabilities identified could pose risks to compliance if not mitigated promptly.
