Overview of Files
******************

#### `main.py`
This file acts as the main entry point for executing a series of data mining and privacy-preserving tasks. It orchestrates the process of association rule mining, fuzzy mining, frequent pattern mining, and privacy-preserving data publishing. Additionally, it facilitates the comparison of mining results before and after applying privacy-preserving techniques.

#### `association_mining.py`
Performs association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm to find associations between items in a dataset.

#### `fuzzy.py`
Implements a fuzzy logic approach to minimize the visibility of sensitive association rules by modifying the dataset accordingly.

#### `frequent_mining.py`
Conducts frequent itemset mining on a dataset to identify frequently occurring itemsets based on a given support threshold.

#### `noise.py`
Adds noise to the dataset as a method of privacy preservation, specifically targeting sensitive itemsets to obscure their presence.

#### `ppdp.py`
Defines a class for privacy-preserving data publishing, applying techniques such as k-anonymity, suppression, and permutation to protect sensitive information.

#### `asso_min_comp.py`, `fuzzy_comp.py`, `freq_pattern_comp.py`, `noise_comp.py`
These files contain functions to compare the results of data mining tasks (association rule mining, fuzzy logic-based mining, frequent pattern mining, and noise-added mining, respectively) between original and anonymized datasets, evaluating the impact of privacy-preserving techniques.

Functions and Library Usage

#### `main.py`
The `main.py` file serves as the orchestrator for a suite of data mining and privacy preservation operations. It outlines a comprehensive workflow that includes:
- Executing various data mining techniques (association rule mining, fuzzy logic-based mining, frequent pattern mining, and noise addition).
- Applying privacy-preserving techniques to the data.
- Comparing the results of data mining before and after anonymization to assess the impact of privacy-preserving methods.

**Functions and Their Descriptions:**
- **`main()`**: The main function coordinates the workflow, including data loading, mining, applying privacy techniques, and evaluating the outcomes. It performs the following steps:
  - Suppresses warnings, particularly `DeprecationWarning`, to clean up the output.
  - Specifies dataset paths and lists sensitive attributes.
  - Executes association rule mining and saves the results.
  - Performs fuzzy logic-based mining to obscure sensitive rules and saves these results.
  - Conducts frequent pattern mining to identify common itemsets and saves the outcomes.
  - Adds noise to the dataset for privacy preservation and mines the noisy dataset for frequent patterns.
  - Initializes a privacy-preserving data publisher (`PPDP`) and applies various anonymization techniques, including k-anonymity, suppression, and permutation, to the data.
  - Publishes the anonymized dataset and repeats the mining processes on this dataset to compare the impact of the privacy-preserving methods on data utility and privacy.
  - Compares the results of data mining operations before and after anonymization across different methods, evaluating the trade-offs between data utility and privacy.
