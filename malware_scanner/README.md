# Malware Signature Scanner

A small C# console app that detects malware-like behavior by matching **system call sequences** in trace logs.

This project is a reimplementation of a malware detection lab using C#. It mimics static analysis of DLL injection behavior by scanning for known malicious syscall patterns.

---

## How It Works

- Reads a list of system calls from `system_trace.txt`
- Compares sliding windows against a **hardcoded malicious syscall sequence**
- Flags the file as either:
  - **MalwareDetected**
  - **BenignApplication**

---

## Example Malicious Sequence

The signature is based on basic **DLL injection** behavior:

```csharp
var maliciousSequence = new List<string>
{
    "OpenProcess",
    "VirtualAllocEx",
    "WriteProcessMemory",
    "CreateRemoteThread"
};
```
## Usage

1. **Clone or copy** the project
2. Open terminal in the project folder
3. Run the app with **dotnet run**
4. Check the terminal output for detection results

## Next Features (Stretch Goals)

- Gap-tolerant pattern matching
- Multiple signature profiles
- Real-time monitoring via ETW
- Basic GUI (WPF or WinForms)
